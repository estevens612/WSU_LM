More specifically, in the context of airline industry, I develop empirical models to investigate the links between incumbents’ marketing actions and a competitor’s market entry, exit, and threat of entry decisions, and how these links may vary over time.",Empirical Marketing Strategy; Market Entry and Exit; Market-Based Assets; Product Failure; Panel Data Econometrics; Hazard (Survival) Models; Airline Industry,,Teaching:Marketing Research; Marketing Analytics; Marketing Strategy; Business to Business Marketing; Competitive Analysis; Customer Relationship Management and Data Mining,"I also have three years of work experience in FMCG industry, including marketing researcher and product manager positions.

Jones Distinguished Professor,Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences,Biological Sciences,(316) 978-6088,george.bousfield@wichita.edu,,"431, Hubbard Hall",Main Campus,,,"Research InterestsMy laboratory is interested in the structure-function relations of the gonadotropins. These are members of the glycoprotein hormone family, which consists of the three gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and chorionic gonadotropin (CG). The fourth member of this protein family is thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Together, the glycoprotein hormones form a unique subset of the cystine knot growth factor superfamily. While most other superfamily members are located at the C-terminal end of a larger precursor from which they are cleaved, and the N-terminal portion then acts as a regulatory factor, the glycoprotein subunits consist of only the cystine knot domains. The subunits are dissimilar proteins, a common alpha subunit that is differentially glycosylated in each hormone, as well as a hormone-specificbeta subunit. Another unusual facet of glycoprotein hormone structure-function is these hormones are decorated with N-linked and sometimes O-linked glycans, which are necessary for function. The glycans can determine metabolic clearance rates of the hormones and at least some of them are necessary for biological activity, although the mechanism is unknown. Glycosylation varies in two ways: microheterogeneity and macroheterogeneity. The former results from a population of 2-105 glycans found at each N- or O-glycosylation site, while the latter results from partial glycosylation of the hormone-specificbeta subunit. In humans an interesting pattern of glycosylation is found in FSH. The alpha subunit is always N-glycosylated, while the FSHΒ subunit appears to be glycosylated in an all-or-none manner. This produces a FSH glycoform that possesses four N-glycans that we call tetra-glycosylated hFSH and another form that possesses only the alpha subunit N-glycans that we call di-glycosylated hFSH. In young women, di-glycosylated hFSH is the more abundant glycoform present in the pituitary gland, however, there appears to be a progressive loss of this glycoform with increasing age. We are interested in determining if this can be used as a marker for reproductive aging.",Courses TaughtNumberCourse NameBIOL 210General Biology IBIOL 310Human Reproduction: Issues and PerspectivesBIOL 626Reproductive BiologyBIOL 710GlycobiologyBIOL 767Mechanisms of Hormone Action,"Professional ExperienceYear(s)Position Held1974 - 1977Associate Instructor, Indiana University1978 - 1979Predoctoral Fellowship, Robert A.

In inverse problems one tries to reconstruct the causes that yield some observable quantities. Example: the cause for the orbits of the planets to be elliptical is Newton's universal gravitation law. If a mathematical model is given by a partial differential equation with some initial and/or boundary conditions and has only one solution, then the complementary traces of this solution on the boundary bring us the information about coefficients of this equation, or its right hand side, or initial conditions, etc. These coefficients or the right hand side or the initial conditions can be considered as the reason that causes corresponding observable traces. Integral geometry (tomography) problems consist in determining some function or more generally vector or tensor field on a manifold given its integrals over a prescribed family of submanifolds. Here the cause is a tensor field that yields corresponding integrals over submanifolds. Such kind of inverse problems arise in geophysical exploration, material testing, medical imaging, etc.",Partial Differential EquationsLinear AlgebraComplex AnalysisInverse and Ill-Posed ProblemsApplied Functional Analysis,,,,,

One of her favorite experiences in teaching is the joy of introducing someone to a craft she loves and then watching them discover their own particular skills and passions. She also prefers a witty, deeply sarcastic work environment where one must think on their feet in often ridiculous circumstances, which is why she is particularly suited to the theatre. That, and excellent skills with toupee tape and safety pins. When she is not in dress rehearsal she can be found at the nearest used bookstore adding to her library (it’s not a problem, it’s a collection), attempting to grow obscure tropical fruits in too-cold environments, cooking, or watching Korean Variety Shows.","M.F.A.

Recognizing that my undergraduate degree didn't adequately prepare me for the philosophical problems of the work, I turned to philosophy for help understanding things like the nature of homology and function, and the ethics of gene patenting. Somehow I ended up studying Immanuel Kant, who rather predates the discovery of the double-helix. Between grad school and WSU I worked for three years at the Jefferson Institute of Molecular Medicine, Division of Connective Tissue diseases (grants and manuscripts; no benchwork or patient care).Today I can't claim to be an expert in bioinformatics or cell signaling or microbiomes, but I'm certainly interested.

These deeply personal experiences only serve as inspiration for exploring broader community and social issues. I use movement as a tool to excavate emotions and thoughts to transcend boundaries. These lines can become blurred through immersive movement experiences. Social and cultural explorations ask the audience to be present and active contributors to the art work. These performance collaborations, between community and artist, are often followed by facilitated dialogue that sparks important conversation about topics such as vulnerability, gender, race, technology and communication and how we see our bodies in everyday spaces.","Horton Technique, Curriculum Development, Arts-based Research, Community Integration Practices, Assessment – Quantitative and Qualitative, Arts in SocietyMFA, Modern Dance – The University of Oklahoma;MA, Sociology – Wichita State University",,"Modern Dance, Public Scholarship in Dance, Professional Practices for the Performing Artist, Dance Leadership and Production, Auditioning for Dance, Choreography for the Stage and in Community","Educator at Butler County College, Barton County College, the University of Oklahoma and Wichita State University. 5 Degrees of Rotation – Dance Collective; Alithea Mime Theatre","Dance Leadership Award, National Dance Alliance, 2005-2009; Dance Instructor of the Year, National Dance Alliance, 2000, 2005, 2009; Dorothy Hauck Faculty Fellow, Mickey and Pete Armstrong Faculty Excellence in Teaching Award, Kennedy Center National Choreographer (2014 & 2016), Harvester Arts Community Fellow 2017-2019",,,Arts and Agriculture; Integrating Arts into Rural Areas

Specifically, I made efforts to address the role of melts on crustal structures, strain distribution, and strain accommodations during the late stages of a continental rifting. Additionally, I am also actively engaged in analyzing geodetic data such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to study active deformation caused by earthquakes, plate motions, landslides, and induced seismicity.Meanwhile, utilizing geophysical techniques, remote sensing (spectral, thermal and microwave portion of the spectrum, radar interferometric), and Geographic Information Science (GIS) is vital to understand geodynamic processes. Thus, I used these integrated techniques extensively not only to study environmental hazards but to detect deformation caused by plate movements or instigating due to human activities. All these processes will help us to explain how the Earth has evolved and continues to change. Additionally, having a profound knowledge of these dynamic processes serve as an input to make significant contributions towards mitigating the effects of various natural hazards. Furthermore, I am applying LIDAR and GPS to InSAR geodesy (radar interferometric) as supplemental techniques, as well as a time series analysis to provide a complete four-dimensional surface displacement to any natural or induces earth deformation.In light with this, students' success requires to participate in integrated research that involves a multitude of subjects necessitating analytical skills and holistic thinking. Therefore, my goal as an instructor and researcher is to engage my students to participate fully in my research; thus, the scientific community acknowledges their research results through peer-reviewed publications. Research topics and tools mainly used by my research group are listed below, and if you are enthusiastic about these topics, please contact us to join our school.

Jason Flanders,Scene Shop Manager / Scenic Technology Specialist,,,316-978-5389,jason.flanders@wichita.edu,,,,"An innate hatred of cubicles has led Jason Flanders to a lifetime search to defeat his arch nemesis ...Boredom. Jason has held many jobs. Jobs as diverse as USAF Heavy Equipment Operator, Day Care Provider, Combat Engineer and Life Drawing Model. These jobs lasted (some longer than others) until boredom settled into the pores of his existence and those paths were all eventually abandoned. This aversion to boredom eventually led to Art and Theatre where, if boredom were to rear its dull head, it would soon be defeated by new challenges; new skills to learn, new styles and mediums to explore and new messages to be conveyed. The excitement of these new challenges quickly defeated Boredom and its cubicle minions. The ongoing struggle to keep boredom at bay led Jason to earn the BA in Theatre from Arkansas Tech University and to continue his education with the Scenic Design MFA from the University of Oklahoma. Teaching and exploring Art and Theatre as the Scenic Technology Specialist and Scene Shop Manager for the School of Performing Arts at Wichita State University has proven to be the perfect weapon to insure Boredom’s defeat. The variety of Design and technical requirements inherent within the realms of Musical Theatre, Theatre, Opera and Dance has all but guaranteed that Boredom will remain subdued. However, lest Boredom sneak, thief like, into the corners of Jason’s soul, he continues to challenge himself to remain vigilant by branching out into Printmaking, Sculpture, wood working and other areas in order to keep boredom at bay. By the way, this is the first Bio Jason has written that he wasn’t bored with. . .mostly.","Scenic and Prop construction, Design",,"Stagecraft, Scenic and Prop Construction, Problem Solving, Making cool stuff",,,Continuing development of Amputee Assistive Device,,

With the research group I joined for my PhD degree (Mentor – Dr. Wendell W. Leavitt; Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology), I participated in some of their analyses of steroid hormone/receptor regulation in the hamster uterus. However, the real focus of my thesis project was development and characterization of a unique experimental hamster model for the human “DES syndrome”. Indeed, it was that medical misadventure that established diethylstilbestrol (DES) as a transplacental carcinogen and the prototypical endocrine disruptor agent.2. My initial post-doctoral position (Mentor – Dr. Benjamin J. Danzo; Vanderbilt University School of Medicine) was with a group that studied the structure and regulated function of estrogen receptors in male reproductive tract organs. My project with that group involved analyses of the function and modification of estrogen receptors by a protease active in the epididymis of mature but not immature rabbits; a process that may be responsible for decreased estrogen sensitivity in the adult epididymis.3. With my next mentor and collaborator (Dr. Robert W. Harrison III; Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences), I investigated the biochemistry and molecular biology of glucocorticoid receptors. In particular, my project focused on the dynamics of glucocorticoid receptor protein levels and the effects of such dynamics on specific glucocorticoid-dependent responses. Those studies greatly expanded my molecular manipulation and analytical skills plus they required me to master new in vitro (cell culture) techniques.4. While at WSU, my continued engagement with the topics of endocrine disruption in general and the DES Syndrome in particular included further definition of the progression and molecular aspects of that phenomenon in both the female and male hamster reproductive tract. Recently, we expanded our investigation of the phenomenon to the epigenetic level. More specifically, we initiated studies of altered miRNA expression in our experimental system and they again involved both undergraduate and graduate students. It is also important to note that such activities are very relevant to the paradigm now recognized by NIH as the Fetal Basis of Adult Disease or FeBAD.5. Importantly and as introduced in the Personal Statement section above, key findings about the basic mechanisms of neonatal DES-induced disruption of the female reproductive tract relied on my ability to develop and teach other scientists and students the very effective and compliant hamster cheek pouch transplantation protocol. More specifically, use of that protocol allowed us to prove that neonatal DES exposure directly and permanently disrupts the developing hamster uterus (initiating event) so that it responds abnormally later in life to stimulation promoting event) with the natural ovarian steroid, estradiol. We are now generating Proof-Of-Principle results that support further testing of the cheek pouch as a xenotransplantation site and as the basis of a patient “avatar” system for human ovarian cancer and, most recently, human head and neck squamous cell cancer.",,"While serving as Department Chair, I continue to teach at both the undergraduate and graduate levels (BIOL 527, Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy [lecture and lab]; BIOL 534/535, Human Physiology [lecture and lab]; and BIOL 730, Cancer Biology [lecture]) and maintain an independent research agenda.That agenda involves cellular and molecular studies using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. More specifically, I developed a unique animal experimental system to study: 1) the topic of endocrine disruption in general and 2) a medical misadventure known as the “DES Syndrome” in particular. It is important to note that key findings about the fundamental mechanisms of neonatal DES-induced endocrine disruption in our system depended on my success in developing a hamster cheek pouch transplantation protocol and passing on that protocol to other investigators, graduate students, and even undergraduate students. Also, through my participation with the K-INBRE, WMREF, and KUMC-W entities defined above and below, I am directly involved with the now expanding partnership between WSU and the local biomedical community; a partnership that includes a growing cohort of Translational Research projects.","1975-1977 -Junior Instructor, University College, Northeastern University, Boston, MA.1978 -Instructor, University College, Northeastern University, Boston, MA.1982-1984 -Research Associate (mentor – Dr. Benjamin J.

I approach these topics by testing ecological theory and look for ways to use this understanding to guide the management and restoration of ecosystems. Below are six specific examples of my research:Effects Soil Heterogeneity and Species Aggregation on Plant DiversityEnvironmental heterogeneity is one of the most intuitive explanations for differences in plant diversity within and among communities. This view is corroborated by a number of observational studies that successfully relate resources such as light, soil moisture, soil nitrogen or other soil variables to plant diversity patterns. Surprisingly, experimental field experiments have failed to support the observational relationship calling into question whether fine-scale soil heterogeneity is important to plant diversity. Using a unique experimental approach, Brandon Williams and I have found that plant diversity is higher under experimentally enhanced soil heterogeneity at least during the early phases of community assembly (see images below).Vertical soil profile illustrating different strata associated with soil forming processes and rooting activityExample of soil patch structure allocated to heterogeneous and homogeneous plots (M is a mixture of strata 1-3)Process of creating plots.Process of creating plots.Process of creating plots.Process of creating plots. Plant community after three growing seasons.Plant community after three growing seasons.One shortcoming of our initial experiment is that species were sown uniformly across plots. This approach does remove seed limitation within plots, but does not represent the spatial heterogeneity created by non-random seed arrival found in natural communities and that source of spatial structure may be very important to species coexistence and diversity. For example, in a previous experiment I found that spatially aggregated seed dispersal can enhance plant diversity in the short (Houseman 2014 J of Plant Ecology) and long term (unpublished data). We have recently been funded by the National Science Foundation to test the relative importance spatially aggregated seed and soil heterogeneity on plant diversity. Once again we are using the soil heterogeneity manipulation similar that Williams & Houseman 2014 but adding plant spatial aggregation (40 species sown uniformly or in aggregated distributions) at two different spatial scales (patch sizes of 0.04 and 0.16 m2). In addition to conducting the experiment in a tallgrass prairie in Kansas (warm-season grassland), we have a second identical experiment in a cool season grassland located near Tartu, Estonia. This is a collaborative project with Bryan Foster (University of Kansas), Tony Golubski (Kennesaw State University), and Lauri Laanisto (Estonian University of Life Sciences).Houseman, G. R. 2013.

Ecology. doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2837Restoration of grasslands across a precipitation gradient: Trophic links and a return of grazersGiven the loss of North American grasslands over the past two centuries, restoring and managing grassland is an important conservation issue. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a USDA program that has reestablished grasslands in areas dominated by row-crop agriculture, provided critical habitat for many grassland organisms, and has been ongoing for more than three decades. In Kansas, the CRP program currently has over 2 million acres—much of which is re-established, native grassland; however, there is currently no dominant grazer on most of these sites, despite the critical role that bison historically played in these systems. We are testing the functional linkages among plants, insects, and birds across these restored grasslands. We know that the plant community provides structure and food resources for insects. In turn, insects are a protein-rich food resource that is important for bird, nest success. Additionally, many grassland birds rely on the plant community for predator protection and additional food resources. We examining these structural and functional linkages among the three trophic levels to quantify the success of these restored systems and determine whether the careful utilization of cattle grazing can enhance habitat heterogeneity and increase wildlife diversity and abundance. However, the potential benefits of these grazers are likely to vary with plant productivity. Consequently, we are examining the responses across the major precipitation gradient found in Kansas that creates systematic variation in plant productivity (e.g. short to tallgrass prairie). Furthermore, these sites will include two CRP plantings (CP2 and CP25), which differ in the number of forbs planted. In total, the project will include 108 CRP sites across Kansas. In addition to my lab, the research team includes Mary Liz Jameson (entomologist, Wichita State University) and Bill Jensen (avian ecologist, Emporia State University).Invasive Species: searching for an Achilles’ heelMy lab has been working on the ecology of sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) in both restored and grazed prairie. Specifically, we have addressed early invasion, timing of fire, plant-soil feedbacks, soil legacies, dispersal, negative density-dependent germination, and a landscape model addressing spread and control (see references below). Currently, Esra Buyuktahtakin (Wichita State University) and I have a USDA grant to test and refine our landscape model across multiple ranches in eastern Kansas. Our preliminary work on the optimization model relied on very limited data available from the literature or unpublished data. The goal for this next project is to collect data at realistic scales in grazed prairies which are often heavily invaded in Kansas and are often grasslands of high conservation value. The initial model predicted that the most cost effective control of L. cuneata would occur at the 3-year intervals because there was a 1-2 year delay before any specific location was able to recover from the seedbank and begin to spread. We are testing this prediction by applying herbicide to 50, one-acre plots in which herbicide is applied at 1, 2, or 3 year intervals. These plots are distributed across multiple ranches and various levels of plant productivity. In addition to refining our economic model, we hope that comprehensive quantification of demographic characteristics under different cattle management and soil conditions will yield new insights into the ecology of the plant and possibly a weakness that we could use to control sericea with non-chemical methods. The Tallgrass Legacy Alliance is also providing financial support to cover additional work on seedbank and methods for detecting and tracking the spread of sericea across large landscapes.Sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) ResearchQuick, Z.

AbstractEffects of herbivore diversity on native plant communitiesHerbivores can have strong effects on native plant biomass, but little is known about how different herbivore groups may independently or interactively effect plant species. Leland Russell and I are testing this idea by reducing access to grassland plots by insect and non-bovine mammals in a restored Kansas grassland (see below). Additionally, fertilizer is applied to half of the plots to test whether the effects of these herbivore groups vary with soil fertility.Experiment ongoing....Community Convergence and Divergence in Response to PerturbationsBecause the outcome of species interactions is dependent on environmental conditions, climate change—including alteration of atmosphere deposition of N—may alter the structure of communities. One interesting way to test this for communities is to quantify the variability (dispersion) of communities in response to perturbations. For example, in a long-term nutrient addition experiment in low-productivity sand prairie, we found that increased fertility reduced diversity at small scales, but also led to greater variability in plant community composition than unfertilized plots (see reference below). This increased variability following perturbation suggests that it may be difficult to predict the response of communities to human alteration of environmental conditions. Currently, we have an experiment underway to test how initial conditions may influence the community dispersion in grassland systems (see community assembly experiment below). Additionally, I am part of a working group (Avolio, La Pierre, Isbell, Grman, Johnson, Wilcox) applying these ideas to plant community responses to global change (http://corredata.weebly.com/).Houseman, G. R., G. G. Mittelbach, H. L. Reynolds, and K. L. Gross. 2008. Perturbations alter community convergence, divergence, and formation of multiple community states Ecology 89:2172-2180.Avolio, M. L., K.

AbstractCommunity Assembly and the Development of DiversityWhile species pools and immigration are likely to influence diversity, it is unclear whether the results are sensitive to the sequence of colonization events (community assembly). If communities are structured by the interaction between species traits and environmental conditions, community assembly is predicted to be a deterministic process. However, neutral theory predicts that community assembly is a stochastic process driven by births, deaths, immigration and evolution. Currently, I am collaborating with Bryan Foster’s lab to test the relative importance of these neutral and niche based processes on community assembly in northeast Kansas. In this experiment, we are manipulating species diversity and composition of plant species. After removing extant species, we seeded 240 plots in various combinations of plant species diversity and species traits. We are monitoring changes in diversity through time as a function of initial species composition (note differences among plots marked by the white posts in the pictures below) In addition to providing a strong test of ecological theory, the results will quantify how initial diversity and species composition impact the development and maintenance of plant diversity in grassland restorations.Experiment ongoing....Working GroupsCoRRE (COmmunity Responses to Resource Experiments). Initially funded by the LTER network, this working group is attempting to compile ecological community data from experiments that manipulate at least one resource (e.g. water, light, nutrients, etc.). Most of the data available in the literature are not useful for meta-analysis because the published information is highly simplified (richness or evenness) or is incomparable (e.g. ordination diagrams). Our working group has complied 101 datasets thus far. In addition to a conceptual paper (Avolio et al. 2015), several other papers are currently in preparation. http://corredata.weebly.com/ Wilcox, K. R. T., A. T.; Koerner, S. E.; Grman, E.; Hallett, L.

Melissa Penkava Koza,Costume Shop Manager & Production Coordinator,,,316-978-3401,melissa.koza@wichita.edu,,,,"I find my joy in bringing students of all ages the ability to apply their knowledge of technical theatre to real world problems and situations. I encourage students to take artistic risks and engage in self-evaluation. I enjoy working backstage and figuring out the logistical puzzles of wardrobe and quick changes. Because of my musical background, I have a particular interest in opera and musical theatre—though my passion is for the storytelling inherent to the performing arts as a whole. My history as a first-generation college student from a lower-middle class family drives my desire to increase accessibility to the arts across the region. In many spaces around the world, the arts are viewed as a luxury or a hobby—at the core of my thinking is the fact that art is essential, it is intrinsic, and it is valid work worth a real income and a livable wage.","MFA in Theatrical Design and Production (Costume) – The University of MemphisBM in Voice Performance, Theatre Minor – Bowling Green State University",,,"Costumer/Instructor – Saginaw Valley State University in University Center, Michigan Costume Shop Supervisor – Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee.In recent years, her costuming and wardrobe work has been seen at Music Theatre Wichita, Saginaw Valley State University, Rhodes College, Opera Omaha, the BLUEBARN Theatre, Opera Memphis, Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, Germantown Community Theatre, and The University of Memphis.

Besides holding degrees in Theology and History of Religion as well as in Philosophy—all received from the University of Heidelberg—he received in 2006 his doctoral degree in social/cultural anthropology form the same university. As a member of a research group on ritual theory and the history of religions, he carried out research in 2000 on the Yasna, a daily performed ritual of Zoroastrian high-priests. Together with Refika Sariönder, he conducted fieldwork in 2002 in Istanbul among the Alevi on the reflexive dynamics of the cem, a weekly observed community ritual. Since 2010, he studies the coexistence of religious minorities in Turkey and more specifically on the local and global dynamics of inter-religious relations in Hatay, the southernmost province of Turkey. His current research is primarily on Christian and Muslim communities in Antakya (formerly Antioch). He is member of an international research collaboration, “Reassembling Democracy: Ritual as Cultural Resource,” funded by the Norwegian Research Council. The aim of his research is to inquire the impact of the interreligious Antakya Choir of Civilizations on transforming the interaction of the local religious communities and to analyze the internal dynamic of this interreligious choir. Besides, he was in 2014-2015 visiting scholar in the research group “Local Dynamics of Globalization in the Premodern Levant,” funded by the Centre of Advanced Study at the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, which allowed him to further his studies of local infrastructure of pilgrimage sites in the northern Levant in a more historical perspective.","Religious Minorities and Cultural Dynamics in Turkey and the Middle East; Syncretism, Hybridity, and the Dynamics of Interreligious Contact; Aesthetics of Religion and Semiotics of Ritual; Method and Theory in the Study of Religion; Concept Formation in Study Ritual; Reflexivity in Ethnographic Fieldwork; Ritual Theory; Anthropology of Islam; Visual Anthropology",https://www.tf.uio.no/english/research/projects/redo/partnere/kreinath.html,,https://www.tf.uio.no/english/research/projects/redo/news/2014/listen-to-jens-kreinath-s-lecture-on-interritualit.htmlhttps://www.tf.uio.no/english/research/projects/redo/news/2014/lecture%3A-filming-rituals.html,,,http://turkishstudies.org/documents/pdf/grants/hall_of_fame/JensKreinath.pdfhttp://www.wennergren.org/grantees/kreinath-jens-michael,http://armenianstudies.libsyn.com/website/unpacking-armenian-studies-with-dr-jens-kreinathhttps://www.facebook.com/uscarmenian/videos/unpacking-armenian-studies-with-dr-jens-kreinath/2451157035104625/https://thesunflower.com/48886/lifestyle/features/magic-witchcraft-and-religion-professor-dedicated-to-the-study-of-the-unknown/https://thesunflower.com/40711/news/war-and-peace-photo-exhibition-frames-aleppo-through-two-different-lenses/

Louis Medvene PhD.,"Professor of Psychology, Emeritus",,,,louis.medvene@wichita.edu,,,,,,"Romantic Relationships: I have carried out research on how social cognition in close personal relationships - thinking in terms of ""us"" versus ""me"" - is related to judgments of fairness and equity, and how those, in turn, are related to relationship satisfaction. When people in relationships think in terms of ""we"" versus ""me"", levels of satisfaction are higher despite inequities;Caregiving Relationships: I have applied interdependence theory to relationships between certified nurse aides (CNAs) and nusing home residents, making the case that personal relationships are functional and approriate. This research has demonstrated that person-centered caregiving - as measured through observational coding of behavioral interactions- is associated with the development of relationship commitment and satisfaction. This research has also demonstrated that social cognition - i.e. the complexity of caregivers' perceptions of residents - is related to their ability to provide person-centered care;Quality of Life Among Older Adults: I have carried out research on how older adults' ""possible selves"" - how they picture themselves in the near future - is related to their future time perspective (time left) and their sense of self-efficacy in achieving their hoped-for possible selves and avoiding their feared possible selves. The goal of this research is to identify factors associated with high quality of life. I have also carried out research on the importance of social networks in the lives of older adults and demonstrated that computer training on the use of social media can enhance social engagement.","The term ""successful aging"" has been used for the past 30 years to stimulate theory, research and action around how quality of life and health can be maximized as we age. In my teaching I explore several different ways in which ""successful aging"" has been defined including Rowe and Kahn's more biomedical thinking and Baltes' life-span developmental approach. Rowe and Kahn are especially interested in the conditions under which people age without disease or disability. Baltes has been interested in how purpose and meaning can be maintained despite losses, through the use of the adaptational strategy of selective optimization;Intergenerational teaching and learning are becoming increasingly important on college campuses as larger number of older adults are taking classes and undergraduates are considering working with older adult populations. In my teaching I use self-directed learning teams - composed of younger and older students - to explore the aging process itself, as well as societal changes in healthcare, the workplace, technology and marketing that might help to create more ""age-friendly"" communities;The social and developmental foundations of behavior are of long-term interest to me. In my teaching I review research and theory regarding attachment theory, dual theories of social cogntion - i.e. automatic and controlled processes - , the development of self-concept, and of social stereotypes. I also focus on theories regarding the development and maintenance of social relationships, as well as theories of aging.

Letterpress is a form of relief printing and was used commercially from the early 1800s through the 1970s. I enjoy the tactile nature of letterpress. Each element and letter in the design has to be picked up and placed on the press by hand. Each color is printed individually, so you create the image slowly, building it with color as you print. You are limited by the number of characters, fonts and sizes that you physically have on hand. Some of the letters have been heavily used and the scars of their use show up in your design.

Heat transfer enhancement is relevant to sustainability of energy resources – a specialty that is regaining its pre-eminence. Single-phase flow and boiling heat transfer in micro- and mini-channels have applications in Energy and water conservation. While these have been under investigation over the last two decades, second generation technologies are being studied in the form of surface alterations using Carbon NanoTubes (CNTs), Nanostructured particles, and nano-fluids. The research has impact on air-cooling technologies and on two-phase bubble generation and dynamics on heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics.Biothermal applications involve interdisciplinary research in thermodynamic and fluid-flow principles to physiological problems – specifically relating to obesity, exercise, and cardiovascular diseases in aging populations. Flow characteristics involving nano-fluids, microchannels, and wall stresses have direct applications to cardiovascular issues, cryotherapies and fluid therapies.",,,,,,

In my courses, my primary objective is to help students develop intellectually and artistically autonomous work while fostering an energetic classroom community. Through discussion of readings and artwork, thoughtful critique, collaborative exercises, slide lectures and field trips, I challenge students to cultivate their own lines of artistic inquiry into the formal, technical, and conceptual issues that most interest them. As a result, my students learn to how to appreciate, understand, and assess works by others while gaining insight into how to create work that is expressive and communicative.Ultimately I see my role in the classroom as a guide and a facilitator. In each class, I strive to put into place an infrastructure that allows students to drive their own learning. My most fundamental goal is always to prepare a student to enter into the broader art world with an ability to decipher the work they encounter and make relevant products themselves. To this end I put great effort into educating both myself and my students about technical developments and artistic movements. In classes, we consider how lens-based media has dramatically changed in the last decade, and I push students to reflect those changes in their work.",,,,,

Substantial work was done at the Great Salt Plains of Oklahoma to isolate and characterize halotolerant and halophilic microbes growing in high NaCl. This work was extended to salty environments (Hot Lake and Basque Lake) rich in magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts), as this is an important salt on Mars. The astrobiology work impacts the search for life on Mars and forward planetary protection (keeping Mars clean). We measure tolerances to other Mars salts as well, including perchlorate and chlorate salts. Related studies on sugars teach us more about living in very high solutes, and hence, low water activity. We have demonstrated bacterial growth in saturated and eutectic solutions of Mars salts. Dry salts on Mars may absorb humidity from the atmosphere and form dense brines with low freezing points that may remain liquid on Mars.Beyond our work with NASA, we participate in collaborative projects in medical microbiology. We are working with WSU Chemists on a new class of antibiotics, we call liptins, which bind specifically to bacterial lipids. Liptins seem to be specific, with low toxicity, and are active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and Mycobacteria. A project with WSU Biomedical Engineers is examining the formation of biofilms on advanced materials that can be used as coatings for bone implants and cardiac stents. An earlier project on feather microbiology led to the discovery of plant pathogens on wild bird feathers, perhaps carrying disease over long distances. Many of the feather isolates exhibit keratinases that degrade the protein keratin. These have great potential for use in dermatology and the hide industry.",,General Biology IGeneral MicrobiologyApplied and Environmental Microbiology,"Professor 2012-presentBiological Sciences, Wichita State UniversityProfessorCurriculum and Instruction, Wichita State University 2014-presentColeman Foundation Faculty Fellow in EntrepreneurshipBarton School of Business, Wichita State University 2014-presentAffiliated FacultyBiomedical Engineering, Wichita State University 2013-present",,,,

Using Arabidopsis as a model, we are studying the role of some unknown genes and miRNAs during pollen development and function.2) Molecular interactions between Medicago truncatula and Macrophomina phaseolinaMacrophomina phaseolina is a soil-born fungus that causes charcoal rot disease in many plant species, including economically important crops. The lack of knowledge on the pathogen really limits our ability to control and manage the disease that usually causes severe loss in crop yield.

Li Yao PhD,Professor,Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences,Biological Sciences,(316) 978-6766,li.yao@wichita.edu,,"529, Hubbard Hall",Main Campus,,,"Research InterestElectric fields guided brain neuron migrationEndogenous electrical signals are present in many developing systems and crucial cellular behaviours such as neuronal cell division, cell migration and cell differentiation are all under the influence of such endogenous electrical cues. Effectively directed neuron migration is critical for development and repair in the central nervous system. We recently demonstrated that small electric fields not only guide axonal growth, but also can direct the earlier events of neuronal migration and neuronal cell division. This raises the possibility that applied or endogenous electric fields, perhaps in combination, may direct transplanted neural stem cells, or regenerating neurons, to the desired site after brain injury or neuron degeneration. We are interested in investigating the mechanism of electric fields guided neuron migration and the solutions for the application of electric fields in guiding neuron migration in neurogenesis within the central nervous system.Spinal cord repair and regenerationThe limited functional improvement in in vivo models of spinal cord injury has prevented advancement of regenerative therapy to clinical use due to the multifaceted nature of spinal cord injuries. Biodegradable polymers can simultaneously provide structural guidance at a cellular level and a reservoir for sustained gene delivery. We are interested in developing the functionalised biomaterial scaffolds targeting injury mechanisms at the molecular, cellular and tissue levels of spinal cord injury.Peripheral nerve repair and regenerationAxonal regeneration after injury or disease is the major challenge in both peripheral and central nervous system. In peripheral nerve regeneration, neural conduits have been investigated to bridge nerve defects. In our recent study, the advance in the design of engineered scaffolds that mimic peripheral nerve multiple basal lamina have improved guided axonal regeneration in vivo. Neural tissue engineering is a promising approach for axonal regeneration of critical nerve injury by preventing inhibitory factors and enhancing guided axonal growth.",Teaching InterestMolecular Cell Biology (BIOL 420)Developmental Biology (BIOL 540)Neurobiology (BIOL 640G),"Professional Experience08/2023 - present -- Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, Wichita State University, Wichita, KS08/2017 - 08/2023 -- Associate Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, Wichita State University, Kansas08/2011 - 08/2017 -- Assistant Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, Wichita State University, Kansas 08/2012 - present -- Adjunct Assistant Professor, Department of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine-Wichita, University of Kansas Medical Center, Wichita, Kansas12/2010 -- Visiting Research Fellow, Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Minnesota01/2009 - 09/2009 -- Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Minnesota04/2007 - 05/2007 -- Visiting Research Fellow, EMPA-Swiss Federal laboratory for Materials Sciences and Technology, Switzerland09/2005 - 06/2011 -- Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Network of Excellence for Functional Biomaterials, National Center for Biomedical Engineering Science, National University of Ireland, Galway09/2005 - 03/2007 -- Marie Curie Research Fellow, National Center for Biomedical Engineering Science, National University of Ireland, Galway",,,,
